## üö¶ UK Commute Cost Efficiency Analysis
<p align="justify"> 
A comprehensive data analytics project assessing daily and monthly commute costs, transport efficiency, and city-by-city trends across the United Kingdom. Built using SQL, Excel-based statistical testing, and Power BI dashboards, the project delivers actionable insights to inform cost optimization and urban mobility decisions.
</p>

## üìò Project Overview
<p align="justify">
This project analyzes transportation costs, delays, and environmental impact across major UK cities. By integrating structured datasets with public cost benchmarks, the analysis provides critical insights into commuter behavior, city-level inefficiencies, and potential areas for mobility improvement.

## üîç Objectives
- Clean and structure commute datasets for analysis
- Analyze cost efficiency across different modes of transport
- Benchmark cities based on delays and carbon impact
- Categorize commute cost and distance tiers
- Conduct statistical testing (ANOVA) on mode-based cost differences
- Visualize trends using an interactive Power BI dashboard

## üß∞ Tools Used
- SQL: Preprocessing, transformation, and aggregate analysis
- Microsoft Excel: ANOVA, statistical validation
- Power BI: Dashboard development and executive visualization

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Cleaning, Structuring and Analysis using SQL
- Missing Values: No null values detected across features
- Standardization: Unified column names and SQL-compatible date formats
- Data Types: Converted appropriate fields for query efficiency
- Outlier Detection: No irregular values detected
- Average cost per mode of transport: Train is the most expensive mode. While it may be faster for long distances, it comes at a high financial cost.
- Top 5 routes by best value rank: From the result, the top 5 commute route by best value rank are:
Bath - Bristol, Beeston - Nottingham, Birkenhead - Liverpool, East Kilbride - Glasgow, and Bradford - Leeds.
- Compare daily vs monthly commute costs by city: Overall, commuting is most expensive in Nottingham and cheapest in Leeds on average.

## üìä Statistical Analysis (Excel ANOVA)
- Hypothesis 1: Train commutes are significantly more expensive than driving across UK cities.
- Statistical test: t-test or ANOVA comparing Daily Cost (¬£) by Mode of Commute

-- In Conclusion: The cost difference is statistically significant. Train travel is consistently more expensive than driving across UK cities.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard Highlights
<p align="justify">
This Commute Dashboard shows detailed insights about commuting patterns, cost, and time across different modes of transport and locations in the UK. </p>

## Conclusions
<p align="justify">
The analysis reveals significant differences in commute costs and efficiency across UK cities and transport modes. Train travel is the most expensive and delay-prone, while walking and cycling are free and time-efficient. Nottingham has the highest overall costs, while Leeds is the most affordable. ANOVA results confirm that train commutes are significantly more expensive than driving.
</p>

## Recommendations
<p align="justify">
To improve cost-efficiency and reduce delays, cities should invest in affordable and reliable public transport alternatives, promote cycling and walking for short distances, and optimize intercity train pricing. Commuters should consider cost-effective routes like Beeston-Nottingham or Birkenhead-Liverpool for better value.
